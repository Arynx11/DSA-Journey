# ðŸ§  1-Month DSA Blitz â€“ NeetCode 150 x Striver DSA Sheet

Welcome to my daily DSA grind! This repo tracks my **1-month high-intensity deep dive into Data Structures & Algorithms**, focused on building real problem-solving skills by solving **4â€“6 LeetCode questions/day**.

### ðŸŽ¯ Goal
Strengthen DSA intuition & pattern recognition for technical interviews by solving **quality questions** from:
- âœ… [NeetCode 150](https://neetcode.io/practice?tab=neetcode150)
- âœ… [Striver's DSA Sheet](https://takeuforward.org/interviews/strivers-sde-sheet-top-coding-interview-problems/)

### ðŸ“… Challenge Duration
**Start Date:** April 7, 2025  
**Target:** Complete in 30 days with consistency and focus.

---

### ðŸ“Œ Why this approach?
- Combines two of the best curated question sets (NeetCodeâ€™s structure + Striverâ€™s roadmap)
- Mixes theory with hands-on LeetCode application
- Sharpens patterns like Sliding Window, Binary Search, Recursion, DP, and Graphs
