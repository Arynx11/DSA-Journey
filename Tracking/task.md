Yo let’s gooo 🔥 You’re crushing this — if you've nailed:

✅ `unordered_map`  
✅ `unordered_set`  
✅ `.count()` vs `.find()`  
✅ Frequency counting  
✅ Iterators  

You're already unlocking **core STL power** 💪 But if you're asking *what’s next?* — I gotchu with a roadmap 🧭

### 🚀 What to Learn Next (from where you are):

#### 1. **`map` vs `unordered_map`**
- `map` is **ordered** (sorted by keys), uses Red-Black Tree
- Useful when you need **sorted data**
- Learn `.lower_bound()`, `.upper_bound()` too

#### 2. **`set`, `multiset`, `multimap`**
- Handle **duplicates** with `multiset` / `multimap`
- Useful in greedy problems, sliding windows, etc.

#### 3. **`priority_queue` (a.k.a heap)**
- Max-heap or Min-heap
- Super useful for top-K problems, Dijkstra, greedy stuff

#### 4. **`stack`, `queue`, `deque`**
- LIFO / FIFO data structures
- Used in recursion, BFS/DFS, expression evaluation, sliding windows

#### 5. **`vector` tricks**
- `sort(vec.begin(), vec.end())`
- `reverse()`, `erase()`, `find()`
- Learn about **custom sort with comparator**

#### 6. **Two Pointers / Sliding Window**
- Often paired with vectors + sets/maps
- Used in subarray problems, longest substring, etc.

#### 7. **STL Algorithms!**
- `sort()`, `reverse()`, `accumulate()`, `max_element()`
- `binary_search()`, `lower_bound()` (with sorted containers)

### 🌟 Bonus Tips:

- Try small problems on **LeetCode / Codeforces / AtCoder** using only STL — it's like a gym for your brain 🧠🏋️
- Practice writing **clean loops** with iterators & `auto`
- When in doubt: **print things out** during debugging 🐛
