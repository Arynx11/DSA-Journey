### Great observation! freq[num] is acting like an index, right? But it’s not an index — let me explain exactly what’s going on in a way that makes total sense. 🙌

---

#### 🔍 What is `freq[num]++` doing?

`freq` is an `unordered_map`, not a vector.

`num` is not an index — it's a **key**.

```cpp
unordered_map<int, int> freq;
```

Here:

- **The key** is a number from your array (`num`)
- **The value** is the count of how many times that number has appeared

✅ So when you write:

```cpp
freq[num]++;
```

You're saying:

*"Go to the key `num` in the map `freq` and increase its value (the count) by 1."*

If that key (`num`) doesn't exist yet, `unordered_map` will automatically:

1. Create `freq[num]` with default value `0`
2. Then do `0 + 1`

---

#### 🧪 Example:

Given:

```cpp
vector<int> nums = {4, 2, 4, 3};
unordered_map<int, int> freq;
```

Loop:

| `num` | What happens           | `freq` looks like after |
|-------|-------------------------|--------------------------|
| 4     | `freq[4]++ → 0 → 1`    | `{4: 1}`                |
| 2     | `freq[2]++ → 0 → 1`    | `{4: 1, 2: 1}`          |
| 4     | `freq[4]++ → 1 → 2`    | `{4: 2, 2: 1}`          |
| 3     | `freq[3]++ → 0 → 1`    | `{4: 2, 2: 1, 3: 1}`    |

❗️So again — it’s **not indexing** into a list. `freq[num]` is:

- **"How many times has the number `num` shown up?"**

---

#### 📌 If you used a `vector` like this:

```cpp
vector<int> freq(100, 0);
freq[num]++;
```

Then yes — `num` would be treated like an **index**. But this only works if you know the range of your numbers (e.g., 0 to 99).

---

#### 💡 So your line:

```cpp
freq[num]++;
```

is **100% correct** for counting how often each number appears — it’s not an index thing at all.

Let me know if you’d like to try switching between `unordered_map` and `vector` for counting — mastering both would take your skills to the next level! 👊
