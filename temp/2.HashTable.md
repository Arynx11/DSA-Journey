Yooo this is such a great question 🙌 — and you’re now crossing into core **data structures** territory, which is 🔥 because it clears up a TON of confusion for most people.

Let’s break it down **super clearly** 👇

---

### 🔹 `unordered_map` and `unordered_set` — what are they?

Both of these are based on a **hash table** under the hood.

So...

- ✅ Yes, both are **hash table implementations**
- ❌ No, `unordered_set` does **not** allow duplicates (more on that below)
- And yes, `unordered_set` is often what people call a **HashSet**
- `unordered_map` is basically a **HashMap**

### 💡 Terminology Breakdown:

| C++ STL            | Concept Name (General) | Keys? | Values? | Allows Duplicates? |
|--------------------|------------------------|-------|---------|---------------------|
| `unordered_set`    | HashSet                | ✅    | ❌      | ❌ (no duplicates)   |
| `unordered_map`    | HashMap                | ✅    | ✅      | ❌ (unique keys)     |
| `unordered_multiset` | Multiset (with hashing) | ✅  | ❌      | ✅ (yes duplicates)  |
| `unordered_multimap` | Multimap (with hashing) | ✅  | ✅      | ✅ (yes duplicate keys) |

So when you hear:

- 🔸 **HashSet** → think `unordered_set` in C++
- 🔸 **HashMap** → think `unordered_map` in C++

They both use **hashing** to get super-fast lookups.

### 📌 Summary in Plain English:

- **Hash table** → general term for the structure (like the engine)
- **unordered_set** → C++ implementation of a **HashSet**
- **unordered_map** → C++ implementation of a **HashMap**
- Both are **based on hash tables**
- Use `.count()` or `.find()` to check if keys exist
